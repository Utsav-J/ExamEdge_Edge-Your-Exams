      "This document is a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for a Student Housing Management System designed for King Saud University (KSU) students. The system aims to streamline student housing operations, from room registration and maintenance requests to handling complaints and generating reports. Recognizing the challenges faced by students on the large KSU campus, the system will be a mobile application, leveraging the ubiquity of smartphones to provide convenient access to essential housing services. The system focuses solely on managing aspects within student housing, excluding any functionalities related to off-campus activities. The document details functional and non-functional requirements, design constraints, logical subsystem design, architectural style, and a phased implementation plan.",
